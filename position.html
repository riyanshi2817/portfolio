    <div class="max">
        <h4>vmax</h4>
        Represents a percentage of the larger dimension of the viewport (either width or height).
        If the viewport width is larger, 1vmax equals 1% of the width.
        If the viewport height is larger, 1vmax equals 1% of the height.
    </div>
    <div class="min">
        <h4>vmin</h4>
        Represents a percentage of the smaller dimension of the viewport.
        If the viewport width is smaller, 1vmin equals 1% of the width.
        If the viewport height is smaller, 1vmin equals 1% of the height.

        units
        <div class="child">
            CSS units are classified into absolute and relative types. Absolute units like px, cm, mm, in, pt, and pc
            have fixed values, with px being the most commonly used for web design. Relative units adjust based on
            context. em and rem scale with font size, where rem is relative to the root element (<html>), making it more
            predictable. % depends on the parent elementâ€™s size. Viewport units (vw, vh, vmin, vmax) adjust based on
            screen size, ideal for responsive layouts. CSS Grid uses fr for flexible column distribution. Units like ch,
            ex, and lh are useful for text layouts. Generally, px, rem, %, and vw/vh are best for modern web design,
            while absolute units like cm and pt are mainly for print.
